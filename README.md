# Landing Page Project

This is my Landing Page project for The Odin Project’s Foundations Course, which is part of The Odin Project curriculum.

## Skills Demonstrated

* Using Flexbox to organize and align page sections

* Strengthening my understanding of layout and structure

* Applying HTML and CSS concepts learned in the Foundations course
