# Landing Page Project

This is my Landing Page project for The Odin Project’s Foundations Course, which is part of The Odin Project curriculum.
In this project, I was given a design to recreate using HTML and CSS. The goal is to build a complete webpage layout from scratch.

## Skills Demonstrated

* HTML structure with semantic tags and content organization

* CSS styling, including colors, typography, and buttons

* Flexbox for layout and alignment of sections and images

* Responsive design techniques using padding and flexible containers

* Integrating and styling images with captions
